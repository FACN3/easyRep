Following the meetup, we need to build an app for people to make it easier for them to report a hazard without them having to give up their identity.

### Goals :zap:
- Allow users to report an enviromental hazard anonymously.
- Allow users to see other reported hazards. 
- Allow user to track his/her own reports by creating an account.


### User Journey :zap:
- As a user I would like to visit the app and easily report a hazard, whether it's a Fire, Dust, Noise, Waste or Water issues.
- As a user I would like to see a review of the email I'm sending.
- As a user I would like to send a report to the right authorities.
- As a user I would like to create an account so that I can track the issues I've sent to see if it's been resolved or not.


### App Flow :zap:
- The user visits the home page where he/she can see a big Report button as well as a View Reports button and an About Us link.
- If the user chooses to click on the Report button, he/she will enter a multi page form in which he/she is asked to choose from the     hazards categories and pick from a list of issues that he/she feels is related to this specific hazard. After that he/she can choose the location and if possible upload a media showing the issue/hazard. 
- Once the form is completed, the user can review the email that will be sent.
- Once the user clicks on Confirm and Sends, the email is automatically forwarded to the right authorities on behalf of EasyRep app.
- If the user chooses to click on View Reports button he/she is prompted to either sign in or create an account in order for him/her to track their own reports and see a list of all reports.
- If the user chooses to click on About Us link on the home page, he/she will be directed to a small discription of the purpose of this app.
